# Math Game

This project brute forces the puzzle given on page 212 of the excellent book [The Art of Game Design by Jesse Schell](http://artofgamedesign.com/). See the accompanying [blog post](http://jackchristensen.com/2009/08/08/solving-a-math-puzzle-with-ruby.html) from 2009 for more details.

To run the solver (it will take a while to run):

    ruby -I. runner.rb

To run the tests:

    ruby -I. math_game_test.rb
